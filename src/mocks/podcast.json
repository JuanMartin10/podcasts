      "description": "It's Episode 48 of the Friday Night Karaoke Podcast, and the theme of the week was #FNKElvis!\nJanuary 8th was Elvis Presley's birthday (and consequently FNK Moderator / Behind the Filter's host Mars Cross and FNK Founder Joe Rubin share the same), so that week the FNK community sang songs from the 50s to tip their hats to the King's big day. It's Now Or Never, so how about A Little Less Conversation and a lot more Jailhouse Rock while we build a musical Bridge Over Troubled Water to ignite our Burning Love for karaoke. If I Can Dream, it'll be about Blue Suede Shoes and That's All Right because FNK is Always On My Mind. Don't Be Cruel, and when we post our best Hound Dog, don't Return To Sender since I'm All Shook Up over The Wonder Of You. So pull up to the Heartbreak Hotel in your Long Black Limousine and get ready for our Unchained Melody to ease your Suspicious Minds - this is Elvis week and we just Can’t Help Falling In Love with your songs!\nFeatured in this episode alongside hosts Mike Wiston and Joe Rubin:\n\nSarah Keen and Mizter Mark with Hound Dog by Elvis\n\nPaul Bright with My Ring Around Your Neck by Elvis\n\nAsthmaBully Jones with Burning Love by Elvlis\n\nBrett Arellano and Simone Tellier with You Dont Have To Say You Love Me by Elvis (originally Dusty Springfield)\n\nJoe Rubin with Let's Play House by Elvis\n\nIsabel Aguilar with It's Now Or Never by Elvis\n\nJames R.

We first met Jimmy when he opened for Jaret Reddick and Rob Felicetti of Bowling for Soup, shared a Miller Light, and the rest is history.SHOW SCOOPED UP SOME LOVE BY SUPPORTING THEIR CHANNELS BELOW:- Band Page: https://www.scoopedupband.com/- YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhNw5snzzQG-e9iYuyHN3w- Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/scoopedup1- Insta: http://instagram.com/scoopedup1Watch the VIDEO VERSION of this podcast here: https://fb.watch/bDlm0KBCVe/FEATURED IN THIS EPISODE ALONGSIDE HOSTS MIKE WISTON AND JOE RUBIN:- Eric Dubrofsky with Drink a Beer by Luke Bryan- Levy Alturas and AsthmaBully Jones with Rock This Town by Stray Cats- Jennifer Adams with Whiskey (Dubrofsky) in the Jar by Metallica- Kristoff Crafton with Devil in the Bottle by TG Sheppard- Scott Berg with Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off by Joe Nichols- Mike Wiston and Joe Rubin with Keelhauled by Alestorm- Sherman Haywood Cox and Ron R Green with Tennessee Whiskey by Chris Stapleton- Scooped Up with Reruns by Scooped UpLove what you hear?

      "description": "They were on top of the world for a song, for a moment, and then...... poof! Gone like yesterday's news. That's right, we are talking about One Hit Wonders, those songs that just creep into your ear canal and take residence in your brain for weeks on end. The band name escapes you, but you can sing every word to the chorus. #FNKOneHit is giving these artists another chance at fame by putting their (one) famous song front and center in our setlists, and singing them for all FNK to hear.It's also the one year anniversary of the Friday Night Karaoke FB group - so Happy Anniversary FNK!IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS EPISODE: Mike's internet went out near the beginning of the episode, and this was salvaged with the audio we would save from attempts to reconnect via 5g (so there are less than the usual 10 songs, and Mike's audio quality is less than perfect after the 2nd song).Featured in this episode alongside hosts Mike Wiston and Joe Rubin:- Happy Anniversary FNK by (many) members of the FNK FB Group- Jennifer with Black Velvet by Alannah Myles- Levy Alturus & Heather Gurnari with What's up by 4 Non Blondes- Mike Wiston with Friend Like Me by Aladdin- Joe Rubin with I Wanna Be Like You by The Jungle Book- Reggie Valenzuela with My Sharona by The Knack- Shelley Corpuz-Kuhn with 99 Red Balloons by NenaLove what you hear?
